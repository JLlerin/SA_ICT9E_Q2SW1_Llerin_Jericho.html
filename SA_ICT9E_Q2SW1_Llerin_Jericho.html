			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">1.Labrador Retriever</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">This medium-sized breed is a favourite of many dog lovers thanks to their family-friendly disposition, trusting nature and high level of intelligence. Their remarkable ability to seek and detect has made them the dog of choice for the visually impaired, hunters and various branches of the military.</th>

			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog2.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">2.German Sheperd</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Despite a large and sometimes intimidating appearance, German Shepherds are often gentle, intelligent dogs with a reputation for being hard working and loyal pets. The German Shepherd’s high level of intelligence, curious nature and keen senses make them a popular guard dog, and they’re known to be highly protective of their family and territory.</th>

		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog3.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">3.Golden retriever</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Much like the Labrador Retriever, the Golden Retriever is renowned for its friendly nature, smarts and abilities as a work dog. Often used as a guide dog, the Golden Retriever’s loyal and playful disposition make them a popular pick for families with small children.</th>

		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog4.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">4.Beagle</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Cute, compact and even-tempered, Beagles were originally bred as hunting dogs, thanks to their ability to sniff-out prey from great distances. Beagles are also renowned for their ability to quickly warm-up to strangers, making them less than ideal as guard dogs but great for sociable owners.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog5.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">5.Bulldog</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Generally obedient and laid-back, one of the Bulldog’s most attractive qualities is the lack of space and strenuous exercise they require. Docile and friendly, Bulldogs are ideal for those with small homes and yards.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog 6.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">6.Yorkshire Terrier</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Tiny and adorable, the Yorkshire Terrier is a popular dog for those with allergies (their coats, while not hypoallergenic, are less prone to shedding). A highly active breed of pup, Yorkshire Terriers are a relatively easy dog to train, but sometimes rambunctious and loud.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog7.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">7.Boxer</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Known for extreme loyalty and a playful yet protective demeanour, Boxers are intelligent dogs, though stubborn and not always the easiest to train. The breed’s name is said to have been based on their inclination to stand on their hind legs and “box” with their paws.</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog8.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">8.Poodle</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Bred in medium, miniature and toy sizes, the poodle is an active, intelligent dog with a penchant for mischief. Their knack for rambunctious play is no doubt reflected in their name, as the word poodle roughly translates to the German word pudle, meaning “to splash about.”
</th>
<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog9.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">9. Rottweiler</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Originally bred to herd livestock, the Rottweiler’s reputation as an aggressive guard dog often overshadows their good natured, family-friendly demeanour.</th>



		</tr>

<tr>
			<th width="375px"colspan="1"><img src="dog10.jpg" width="375px"></th>
			<th width="200px" class="bgcolor"> <h2 style="color: darkred;">10. Dachshunds</h2></th>
			<th width="560 px">Despite their diminutive frame, Dachshunds were originally bred as hunting dogs, and often used to track and retrieve small burrowing animals. Because of their instinct to follow scents and pursue, they can sometimes be hard to train, but are an intelligent and playful breed perfect for patient owners.<th>
